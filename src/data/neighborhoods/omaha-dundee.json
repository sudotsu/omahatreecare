        "question": "Do I need a permit to remove a tree in Dundee?",
        "answer": "Yes, if the tree is on the city right-of-way (between the sidewalk and street), you need a permit from the City of Omaha Forestry Division. Trees on private property (behind the sidewalk) do not require a city permit, but we always verify property lines before removal. Dundee has strict tree ordinances because of its historic canopy—we handle all permit coordination for you."

      {
        "question": "How do I treat Oak Wilt in Dundee's mature bur oaks?",
        "answer": "Dundee is full of 80-100 year old bur oaks, and Oak Wilt is a serious threat here. If you see leaves wilting from the tips inward (starting in mid-summer), that's a red flag. We use fungicide injections for early-stage infections and can set up a treatment plan to protect valuable specimens. For infected trees beyond saving, removal must happen immediately—and we sterilize equipment between jobs to prevent spread to neighboring oaks."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I do if a tree falls during a storm near Memorial Park?",
        "answer": "Call us immediately at (402) 812-3294—we offer 24/7 emergency response. If the tree is on power lines, call OPPD first (402-536-5400), then call us once power is secured. Dundee's mature trees often drop large branches during windstorms, especially the oaks along the park perimeter. We can arrive within 2-4 hours for true emergencies and have the equipment to handle the large-diameter wood common in this neighborhood."
